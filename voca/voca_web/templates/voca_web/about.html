            Vocabin is a language-learning tool which shows example sentences for each inflection of a given word. Sentences can be filtered by difficulty level and category.

        <p class="about-p">
            Knowing how to use a word is arguably just as important as knowing the word itself.
            However, learning new vocabulary in isolation normally doesn't give you the big picture about how a word should be used.
            <br /><br />Once you come across a novel word, Voca aims to give you this context by providing example sentences containing
            the word in all its forms. Studying these sentences allows learners to improve their reading comprehension,
            while drilling key vocabulary and ultimately becoming more confident in how to use that vocabulary in different contexts.
