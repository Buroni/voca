        <p class="about-p">
            Supported languages are limited by available sentence data, and the language support provided by the <a href="https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/pages/pattern-dev#language">Pattern</a>
            library, which is used for word inflection. Future support might be possible by using additional language processing libraries, or providing the option
            to lookup sentences in new languages without the inflection feature.
